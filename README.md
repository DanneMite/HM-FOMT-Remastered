Harvest Mooon - FOMT-Remastered
==============
Building "Harvest Moon - Friends of Mineral Town" in java as a challenge and for learning.

Author: /u/DanneMite - Daniel Edsinger

Plans
-----------------
1: Build the game to run as the original on GBA, like an emulator but in C# and .NET.

2: Add special options to play as boy or girl. (Maybe add same sex marriage)

3: Expand the playable area and number of characters in the game i.e content from Harvest Moon DS. (I consider the DS game to be part of the FOMT universe and should be easy to add in with the similar graphics)
